COMSOL multiphysicals 

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a computational method used in microfluidics and electrokinetic biosensor research to analyze and simulate the behavior of fluids, electric fields, and particles at the microscale level. It involves dividing complex geometries into smaller, finite elements, allowing for accurate modeling and prediction of fluid flow, electrokinetic phenomena, and particle transport within microfluidic devices and electrokinetic biosensors.

In microfluidics, FEA helps in understanding fluid behavior, such as pressure distribution, velocity profiles, and mixing efficiency, within intricate channel networks. It enables researchers to optimize device designs, predict flow patterns, and evaluate the performance of various microfluidic components, such as valves, pumps, and mixers. FEA also aids in studying phenomena like droplet formation, particle trapping, and droplet merging, providing insights for the development of advanced lab-on-a-chip systems.

Regarding electrokinetic biosensors, FEA assists in simulating electric fields, ion concentration distributions, and the movement of charged particles within microchannels. It enables the analysis of electroosmotic flow, electrophoresis, dielectrophoresis, and other electrokinetic phenomena relevant to biosensing applications. By utilizing FEA, researchers can optimize electrode geometries, electrode configurations, and operational parameters to enhance the sensitivity, selectivity, and overall performance of electrokinetic biosensors.

In summary, the application of Finite Element Analysis in microfluidics and electrokinetic biosensor research allows for accurate simulation and optimization of fluid flow, electric fields, and particle transport. It serves as a valuable tool in the design, analysis, and improvement of microfluidic devices and electrokinetic biosensors for various biomedical and analytical applications.


## Analysis of fluid performance and electric field distribution in Nanopore sensing

> Prompt, reliable and specific detection techniques in portable and easy-to-operate systems are of paramount importance to medical diagnosis, especially in emergencies such as pandemic outbreaks or in resource-limited settings. Point-of-care (POC) testing platforms can offer accurate screening in a timely manner, making these tools ideal under these circumstances. Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a fluid handling technology that enables programmable manipulation of discrete droplets (picoliter to microliter range) on a planar surface featured with electrodes, by changing the surface tension of droplets using electric fields. This technology allows user-defined droplet manipulation such as dispensing, mixing, splitting and merging, and thus the platform can be reconfigured for various assays. Although efforts have been undertaken to optimize the accuracy of fluid handling in DMF devices, implementing these devices for POC testing requires the integration of various detection techniques for on-chip assays. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in the integration of analytical tools into DMF devices, and discuss the current challenges and potential solutions as well as future outlooks for an automated, integrative platform for POC applications.
