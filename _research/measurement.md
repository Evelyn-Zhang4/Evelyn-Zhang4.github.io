Electrochemical sensing is a common detection method that measures the electron transfer associated with the oxidation/reduction rate in chemical reactions that occur on electrode surfaces. The sensor generally consists of three electrodes: working electrode (WE, where chemical reactions take place), counter electrode (CE, which carries the current with the WE) and reference electrode (RE, which measures the potential of the WE). Based on the types of signals to be measured, electrochemical sensors are mainly categorized into three types: current (voltammetry/amperometry), potential (potentiometry) and impedance (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy).

> Much of the peace agreement durability literature assumes that stronger peace agreements are more likely to survive the trials of the post-conflict environment. This work does an excellent job identifying which provisions indicate that agreements are more likely to endure. However, there is no widely accepted way to directly measure the strength of agreements, and existing measures suffer from a lack of nuance or reliance on subjective weighting. We use a Bayesian item response theory model to develop a principled measure of the latent strength of peace agreements in civil conflicts from 1975-2005. We illustrate the measureâ€™s utility by exploring how various international factors such as sanctions and mediation contribute to the strength or weakness of agreements.
