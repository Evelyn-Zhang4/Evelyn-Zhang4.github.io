Electrochemical sensing is a common detection method that measures the electron transfer associated with the oxidation/reduction rate in chemical reactions that occur on electrode surfaces. The electrochemical biosensor platforms hold promising applications in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of diseases as robust and adaptable diagnostic and therapeutic systems.

## Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 

> Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful analytical technique used to study the electrical behavior of electrochemical systems. The principle behind EIS lies in the application of an AC (alternating current) signal to the electrochemical cell and analyzing the resulting impedance response. By varying the frequency of the AC signal, EIS can probe different electrochemical processes, such as charge transfer reactions, mass transport, and adsorption/desorption phenomena. EIS offers several key advantages, making it a widely used tool in various fields. Firstly, it provides valuable information about the kinetics and mechanisms of electrochemical reactions, offering insights into reaction rates and surface processes. Secondly, EIS is non-destructive and can be performed under in situ or operando conditions, allowing real-time monitoring of electrochemical systems. Additionally, it has high sensitivity, capable of detecting small changes in electrode interfaces and surface modifications. Furthermore, EIS is versatile and can be applied to various electrode materials and environments, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including corrosion studies, fuel cells, batteries, and biosensors. Overall, the principle and advantages of Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy make it a valuable technique for understanding and optimizing electrochemical processes and materials in numerous scientific and industrial domains.

## Electrochemical biosensor that functionalizes a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based conductive 3D matrix structure on the sensor surface
> The integration of novel functional nanomaterials and analytical technologies represents a significant opportunity for advancing electrochemical sensor and biosensor platforms across a wide range of biomedical applications. By employing new surface modifications, microfabrication techniques, and diverse nanomaterials with unique properties, the design of sensitive and selective electrochemical biological sensor platforms becomes achievable. These platforms offer the potential for in vivo and in vitro medical analysis through a well-planned electrode/solution interface. The advantageous attributes of low-cost, miniaturization, easy fabrication, and simultaneous sensing capability are driving the continued growth of electrochemical biosensing platforms. These platforms have captured the attention of interdisciplinary research fields, including chemistry, material science, biological science, and the medical industry.

Antifouling coating comprising glutaraldehyde crosslinked bovine serum albumin  and rGO nanoflake have displayed exceptional 3D porous matrix structure for biomolecule characterization in biofluids. We chose to include rGO in the matrix because it is a commonly used functional material in biosensors due to its unique properties, such as high surface area, excellent biocompatibility, and high conductivity. Meanwhile, due to the inclusion of rGO, the coating was able to maintain over 70% of the conductivity level, which is highly desirable for electrochemical characterizations. To immobilize the BSA/ rGO-TEPA mixture on the sensor surface, glutaraldehyde was used as crosslinking agent to react with the mixture, forming schiff bases between the carbonyl ends of GA and the amine groups of BSA/ rGO-TEPA.
