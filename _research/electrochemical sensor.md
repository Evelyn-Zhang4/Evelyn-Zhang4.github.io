Electrochemical sensing is a common detection method that measures the electron transfer associated with the oxidation/reduction rate in chemical reactions that occur on electrode surfaces. The sensor generally consists of three electrodes: working electrode (WE, where chemical reactions take place), counter electrode (CE, which carries the current with the WE) and reference electrode (RE, which measures the potential of the WE). Based on the types of signals to be measured, electrochemical sensors are mainly categorized into three types: current (voltammetry/amperometry), potential (potentiometry) and impedance (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy).

> Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful analytical technique used to study the electrical behavior of electrochemical systems. The principle behind EIS lies in the application of an AC (alternating current) signal to the electrochemical cell and analyzing the resulting impedance response. By varying the frequency of the AC signal, EIS can probe different electrochemical processes, such as charge transfer reactions, mass transport, and adsorption/desorption phenomena. EIS offers several key advantages, making it a widely used tool in various fields. Firstly, it provides valuable information about the kinetics and mechanisms of electrochemical reactions, offering insights into reaction rates and surface processes. Secondly, EIS is non-destructive and can be performed under in situ or operando conditions, allowing real-time monitoring of electrochemical systems. Additionally, it has high sensitivity, capable of detecting small changes in electrode interfaces and surface modifications. Furthermore, EIS is versatile and can be applied to various electrode materials and environments, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including corrosion studies, fuel cells, batteries, and biosensors. Overall, the principle and advantages of Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy make it a valuable technique for understanding and optimizing electrochemical processes and materials in numerous scientific and industrial domains.
