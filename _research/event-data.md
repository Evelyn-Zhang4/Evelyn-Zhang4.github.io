In this set of projects, I leverage geospatial event data to explore the microlevel dynamics of political violence. What role can violence at the local level serve in advancing broader political ends? What explains patterns of action and reaction between actors engaged in different types of political violence? How do the differing roles the UN peacekeepers play affect the likelihood that rebel fighters will target them?

Zhang, Y., Rana, A., Stratton, Y., Czyzyk-Krzeska, M.F. and Esfandiari, L.. "Sequence-Specific Detection of MicroRNAs Related to Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma at fM Concentration by an Electroosmotically Driven Nanopore-Based Device" *International Studies Quarterly*.

> MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs that play a critical role in gene regulation. Recently, traces of cancer-related miRs have been identified in body fluids, which make them remarkable noninvasive biomarkers. In this study, a new nanopore-based detection scheme utilizing a borosilicate micropipette and an assay of complementary γ-peptide nucleic acid (γ-PNA) probes conjugated to polystyrene beads have been reported for the detection of miR-204 and miR-210 related to the clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). Electroosmotic flow (EOF) is induced as the driving force to transport PNA-beads harboring target miRs to the tip of the pore (sensing zone), which results in pore blockades with unique and easily distinguishable serrated shape electrical signals. The concentration detection limit is investigated to be 1 and 10 fM for miR-204 and miR-210, respectively. The EOF transport mechanism enables highly sensitive detection of molecules with low surface charge density with 97.6% detection accuracy compared to the conventional electrophoretically driven methods. Furthermore, resistive-pulse experiments are conducted to study the correlation of the particles’ surface charge density with their translocation time and verify the detection principle.

Zhang, Y., Kaynak, A., Huang, T. and Esfandiari, L.. "A rapid bioanalytical tool for detection of sequence-specific circular DNA and mitochondrial DNA point mutations" *International Studies Quarterly*.

> Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been an essential cause of numerous diseases, making their identification critically important. The majority of mtDNA screening techniques require polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, enzymatic digestion, and denaturation procedures, which are laborious and costly. Herein, we developed a sensitive PCR-free electrokinetic-based sensor combined with a customized bis-peptide nucleic acid (bis-PNA) and gamma-PNA (γ-PNA) probes immobilized on beads, for the detection of mtDNA point mutations and sequence-specific supercoiled plasmid DNA at the picomolar range. The probes are capable of invading the double-stranded circular DNA and forming a stable triplex structure. Thus, this method can significantly reduce the sample preparation and omit the PCR amplification steps prior to sensing. Further, this bioanalytical tool can open up a new paradigm in clinical settings for the screening of double-stranded circular nucleic acids with a single-base mismatch specificity in a rapid and sensitive manner.

> Despite the wealth of academic research on United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations, we know remarkably little about the causes of violence against peacekeepers. The dramatic increase in peacekeeper casualties over the past decade make this omission particularly problematic. This article demonstrates that violence against peacekeepers stems from strategic motivations. Peacekeepers in multidimensional PKOs serve as substitute providers of governance and security, working to bolster perceived state capacity and legitimacy in areas where the government cannot send its own forces. Insurgents target peacekeepers in expectation of a PKO unit’s capacity to win over the support of local civilians. We argue that insurgents rely on three primary heuristics to predict the downstream efficacy of peacekeeping forces: personnel composition, peacekeeper nationality, and local levels of insurgent control. We test our theory using an original dataset of geocoded UN multidimensional peacekeeping deployments peacekeeping deployments. Using primary documents sourced directly from the UN covering 10 multidimensional peacekeeping operations from 1999-2018, we present comprehensive time-series data on UN peacekeeper deployment location. We ﬁnd preliminary evidence that peacekeepers are targeted because of their cultural similarity with noncombatants and, in some cases, because they patrol areas where insurgents have political control.

> Research in political science has shown that UN peacekeeping operations are an important tool for ending civil war violence. However, much less is known about how UN peacekeepers affect civilian victimization. Given that civilians bear the primary costs of intrastate conflict,  understanding how international actors can contribute to the resolution of violence affecting them is a pressing concern. How does the presence of UN peacekeepers affect civilian victimization? We address this question by offering a straightforward empirical test of how UN peacekeeping patrols affect the likelihood that there will be violence against civilians. We build on the existing literature and established practices of peacekeeping to argue that peacekeepers deter violence against violence. To test our argument, we examine the case of Mail, the site of large-scale communal violence managed by UN peacekeepers since  2013. We employ a Geographic Regression Discontinuity Design (GRDD) around the border of Mali and Burkina Faso to estimate the causal effect of deploying peacekeepers to an area with growing communal tensions. Ultimately, our research provides robust causal evidence that UN peacekeeping works at the local level to protect civilians.

> Why do governments respond to terrorist attacks with repression, given that terrorism typically produces insignificant damage, and repression often increases popular support for terrorists? This study argues that governments use repression in response to terrorist attacks for both strategic and opportunistic reasons. Strategically, attacks may signal that terrorists are destabilizing the government’s control of its territory. Since state power is endogenous to the territory it controls, these losses may precipitously weaken the government and make it vulnerable to internal and external challengers. Governments therefore turn to violence in an effort to maintain territories that are critical to maintaining power. On the other hand, the specter of destabilization allows opportunistic leaders in quasi-democratic regimes to repress political adversaries and retain office indefinitely in the name of fighting terrorism. We find support for these hypotheses using data on African, Asian, and Middle Eastern states from 1992-2010.
