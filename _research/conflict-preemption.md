In this research, I explor the integration of digital microfluidic (DMF) platform into biosensor for point-of-care testing in an automated and sensitive manner. By deploying cell-based/protein-based immunoassays to the electrochemical biosensors

Digital microfluidics (DMF) has gained attention as an ideal candidate for point-of-care (POC) testing due to its liquid manipulation technology that can manipulate droplets on a planar electrode surface under applied voltage based on the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) principle. DMF devices can operate droplets in an automated and programmable way with minimally trained individuals, and they can be reconfigured on-demand for different applications such as immunological assays, cell-based assays, and DNA amplification. Electrical-based detection is a promising sensing strategy that can be integrated into DMF platforms due to the convenience of integrating electrical sensors into systems composed of electrode arrays. The merging of electrical-based sensors and DMF platforms has enabled various POC applications, particularly immunoassays. So far, electrical sensors have been integrated into DMF platforms for the detection of antigen molecules and rubella virus with high sensitivity and selectivity. These detections are usually based on enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), which immobilizes target molecules on solid surfaces such as magnetic beads and labels captured molecules with enzyme-tagged secondary antibodies. Targets can be quantified by measuring their electrochemical oxidation in the presence of redox probes via amperometric or potentiometric transduction principles using electrochemical electrodes housed on the DMF substrates.

> Prompt, reliable and specific detection techniques in portable and easy-to-operate systems are of paramount importance to medical diagnosis, especially in emergencies such as pandemic outbreaks or in resource-limited settings. Point-of-care (POC) testing platforms can offer accurate screening in a timely manner, making these tools ideal under these circumstances. Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a fluid handling technology that enables programmable manipulation of discrete droplets (picoliter to microliter range) on a planar surface featured with electrodes, by changing the surface tension of droplets using electric fields. This technology allows user-defined droplet manipulation such as dispensing, mixing, splitting and merging, and thus the platform can be reconfigured for various assays. Although efforts have been undertaken to optimize the accuracy of fluid handling in DMF devices, implementing these devices for POC testing requires the integration of various detection techniques for on-chip assays. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in the integration of analytical tools into DMF devices, and discuss the current challenges and potential solutions as well as future outlooks for an automated, integrative platform for POC applications.

## Article

Yuqian Zhang. "A Digital Microfluidic Device Integrated with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy for Cell-Based Immunoassay." *A research reporting an integrated DMF platform for PBMC abudance detection*.

> The dynamic immune response to various diseases and therapies has been considered a promising indicator of disease status and therapeutic effectiveness. For instance, the human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), as a major player in the immune system, is an important index to indicate a patientâ€™s immune function. Therefore, establishing a simple yet sensitive tool that can frequently assess the immune system during the course of disease and treatment is of great importance. This study introduced an integrated system that includes an electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS)-based biosensor in a digital microfluidic (DMF) device, to quantify the PBMC abundance with minimally trained hands. Moreover, we exploited the unique droplet manipulation feature of the DMF platform and conducted a dynamic cell capture assay, which enhanced the detection signal by 2.4-fold. This integrated system was able to detect as few as 104 PBMCs per mL, presenting suitable sensitivity to quantify PBMCs. This integrated system is easy-to-operate and sensitive, and therefore holds great potential as a powerful tool to profile immune-mediated therapeutic responses in a timely manner, which can be further evolved as a point-of-care diagnostic device to conduct near-patient tests from blood samples.

> Immune checkpoint inhibitors have renovated cancer treatment by targeting the interaction between tumor cells and the host immune system. The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 are crucial checkpoint molecules that play a role in downregulating T cell activation, thus inhibiting antitumor immunity.Soluble programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (sPD-L1) is a truncated form of the PD-L1 protein that lacks the transmembrane and intracellular domains. It is released from tumor cells and has been identified to be a crucial element in evading the immune system. sPD-L1 attaches to PD-1 receptors on T cells and impedes their activity, leading to the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis. Elevated levels of sPD-L1 have been found in various cancers, including lung , breast, and gliomas, and have been linked to unfavorable treatment outcomes and a poor prognosis. Therefore, detection of sPD-L1 may provide clinicians with valuable information for patient selection, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction.
