Research Fellow, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.		(Jan. 2021 - present)

Ph.D in Electrical Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA	  (Aug. 2015 - Oct.2020)

B.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China  	(Sep. 2011 - Jun. 2015)

My long term research interest is to establish innovative lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices to detect biomarkers in a rapid and sensitive manner, with focuses on early disease diagnosis and prognosis. My research training started at my undergraduate study on the theoretical analysis of the nanotubeâ€™s oriented-attachment growth mechanism, under the guidance of Dr. Weidong He. As an outcome, I published my first-author paper in the third year of college. This research experience provided me a practical training on building mathematic models to simulate physical performances and establish hypotheses prior to experiments. For my graduate training at the University of Cincinnati, I moved into the field of bioengineering and applied engineering technologies to analyze the properties of biological molecules, under the supervision of Dr. Leyla Esfandiari. My research focused on developing electrical impedance sensors to detect different types of cancer-related biomarkers: microRNA, genomic mitochondrial DNA, and exosomes, during which I gained special expertise in the areas of microfabrication, molecular and cellular biology and finite element analysis simulation. I have been the first author and presenter of 9 international and national influential conferences including the IEEE-EMBS Micro and Nanotechnology for Medicine which I received the second-best paper award in the field. Those presentations have also been matured into peer-reviewed publications. Along with technical practicing, the graduate study sketched a comprehensive outline on my research career development including training on literature review, public speaking and lab management. In the postdoctoral training with Dr. Yuguang Liu, I will continue to develop electrical impedance sensors and integrate into digital microfluidic platforms to achieve in situ detection of proteins from blood samples, which can be further applied to monitor therapeutic responses against personalized medicines in clinics. Overall, I am a highly motivated researcher with a multidisciplinary background in engineering and molecular biology. My academic training and research experience enable me to build a solid foundation in the area of biosensors, thus making me a well-qualified candidate to participate in the research proposed in this application.
