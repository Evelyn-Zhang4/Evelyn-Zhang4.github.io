My research interests focus on creating innovative lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices that can detect biomarkers quickly and accurately, with a particular emphasis on early disease diagnosis and prognosis. My research journey began during my undergraduate studies, where I worked on theoretical analysis of the nanotube's oriented-attachment growth mechanism under the guidance of Dr. Weidong He. As a result of this work, I published my first-author paper in my third year of college. This experience taught me how to develop mathematical models to simulate physical performance and establish hypotheses before conducting experiments.

During my graduate studies at the University of Cincinnati, I shifted my focus to bioengineering and applied engineering technologies to analyze the properties of biological molecules, working under the supervision of Dr. Leyla Esfandiari. I concentrated on developing electrical impedance sensors to detect various types of cancer-related biomarkers, such as microRNA, genomic mitochondrial DNA, and exosomes. This work helped me gain expertise in microfabrication, molecular and cellular biology, and finite element analysis simulation. I have presented my research in nine international and national conferences, including the IEEE-EMBS Micro and Nanotechnology for Medicine, where I received the second-best paper award in the field. These presentations have also been converted into peer-reviewed publications. My graduate studies not only provided me with technical training but also taught me how to perform literature reviews, improve my public speaking skills, and manage a laboratory.

In my postdoctoral training with Dr. Yuguang Liu, I continue working on electrochemical biosensors and integrate them into digital microfluidic platforms to enable the in situ detection of proteins and extracellular vesiciles from blood samples. This work will be crucial for monitoring therapeutic responses against personalized medicines in clinics. As a highly motivated researcher with a multidisciplinary background in engineering and molecular biology, my academic training and research experience have given me a solid foundation in biosensors, making me an ideal candidate to participate in the research proposed in this application.
